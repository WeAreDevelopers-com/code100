How would you describe them? \"Iterators are used to point into sequences of elements.\" Sounds good? More recently, the concept of ranges has been introduced to mean anything that exposes iterators. In particular, ranges include range adaptors for lazily transforming or filtering sequences of elements, and they, too, have iterators. All good? Unfortunately, not. The iterator concept, which we have been using since the advent of C++, is fundamentally flawed. In particular, some iterators must behave differently depending on whether they are meant to point at an element or at a boundary between elements. So elements and boundaries are really two distinct concepts.

Insights from 16 Years of Review Data","description":"Code peer reviews is one of the most mature techniques for quality assurance in software development, first published about as early as the '70s. Yet, we often find they are not used, because people deem them too costly or ineffective. An assessment that directly contradicts our own gut feeling after employing code reviews from day one of our 16-year product history. But what's the truth of it? What are the benefits of code review? Which kinds of issues do they uncover? How do they impact our code? Which factors, such as the reviewing person, influence those results? And ultimately: how much additional time do they actually require?  To answer these and other questions, we analyzed 16 years worth of data from the development of our product Teamscale, from the first prototype to today's enterprise-ready application with 1.5 million SLOC. In my talk, I share our insights and conclusions.

Let's talk about why making a technical design is really important when you're developing a new feature. Technical design helps break down and organize the different steps of creating software. It guides programmers on what to do next and shows how all the pieces of code are connected.

It requires breaking out of the container and modifying the underlying host file system. The challenge we have taken on is to use a more transparent and secure way to achieve the same user experience.  If you want to know what’s possible with Operators and learn about our challenges during development, don’t miss this opportunity to learn from Dynatrace’s real-world experiences. Learn how the configuration changed from manual configuration on a pod level to utilising the operator concept for managing components, a Mutating Webhook to modify application pods and a CSI driver to optimise downloads and storage!","streamprovider":"upload","startdate":"07/18/2024","starttime":"15:30:00","enddate":"07/18/2024","endtime":"16:00:00","type":"Virtual Talk","stage":"Virtual Track 1","format":"pre-recorded","topics":"Containers & Kubernetes","speakers":[{"firstname":"Christoph","lastname":"Müllner","jobtitle":"Sr. Software Engineer & Product Owner","company":"Dynatrace","bio":"Christoph is a Software Engineer and Product Owner at Dynatrace working on simplifying observability on Kubernetes.

That era has passed, and modern cars have rapidly evolved into what can be described as 'tablets on wheels.' Nowadays, all car functions, such as the engine, door locking, or lane assist, are operated by a complex network of embedded software. This system is managed by a vast number of different electrical control units, making it challenging to update and maintain. In recent years, Linux providers have announced in-vehicle operating systems based on the Linux Kernel. The goal is to consolidate software onto a common platform, ultimately utilizing software containers in cars. This opens up possibilities to make development more flexible and enables even DevOps. However, the integration of physical interfaces, such as internal bus systems, temperature sensors, and door actuators, create new security challenges. Not familiar with the automotive world? Don't panic - jump in and enjoy the hitchhiker's guide!","streamprovider":"youtube","startdate":"07/18/2024","starttime":"17:30:00","enddate":"07/18/2024","endtime":"18:00:00","type":"Talk","stage":"Stage 7","format":"live","topics":"Security","speakers":[{"firstname":"Reinhard","lastname":"Kugler","jobtitle":"Applied Research Consultant","company":"SBA Research","bio":"Reinhard’s focus relies on security testing of IT and industrial cyber-physical systems.

By using OpenTelemetry with your serverless apps, you can avoid unexpected failures, increase efficiency, and reduce MTTR to keep consumers happy.  In this talk I’ll focus on enabling observability for serverless apps that apply to any FaaS provider like AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers, and Vercel Functions. I’ll start with an event-driven microservice app running on Cloudflare Workers which uses a key-value store and serverless database for storage.

It was built for monolithic Java applications and also monolihic server databases. However, Hibernate is also known as complex and slow, but we got used to it. The cloud, microservices and serverless have changed Java dramatically, but persistence is still the same. Now AI is making its way into Java and AI requires uncompromising performance.EclipseStore was built to be the next generation Java persistence for modern cloud-native systems and AI. It follows the system prevalence architectural pattern and enables databaseless in-memory data processing by using Core Java features. Different to traditional database systems that provide database-specific data structures or formats, EclipseStore supports the native Java object model for persisting objects. The engine enables seamlessly mirroring any Java object graph of any size and complexity transaction-safe into any binary object storage such as AWS S3. This leads to 3 main benefits:High performance: microsecond response and query time, way faster than comparable JPA queries,Significant cloud database cost savings: for example AWS S3 object storage is 70% - 96% cheaper than any database in the cloud such as AWS RDS PostgreSQL or Maria DB.Simplicity: only one data model (just POJOs), any Java types are supported, no expensive mappings or data conversion, simple architecture, simple schema migration.EclipseStore is a new Eclipse project and open source. It requires Core Java knowledges only, so getting started is easy.

Nowhere is this phenomenon more prevalent than in enterprises, where operational scale and headcount has made it impossible to have a complete mental model of the situation. Engineers have strong opinions about which programming languages are best, but for a long time, Java reigned supreme at big companies. That is no longer the case. Without anyone really noticing the shift, Python disrupted Java to become the de facto programming language for enterprises. It did so precisely because it tackled the problems that came from building enterprise software in a way that Java could not. How is that so? What does Python offer that radically changed how software gets built at organizations big and small? And how newer languages that came along, such as Go and Rust, haven’t been able to put a dent on its dominions, and were forced to recede into niche use cases?

Since then, there has been a debate in the architect community about the value they provide for every app scenario. Some think about leveraging serverless for the full-blown backend. Some are more conservative and consider using it only for event-driven features requiring massive scalability. The serverless hype was followed by Microsoft (Azure Functions) and Google (Cloud Functions). The challenge with these technologies comes from the fact that even though their features are alike, their implementation isn’t. That makes it impossible to leverage the same code base to deploy a serverless app to multiple cloud providers, breaking the promise of an inter-connected, multi-cloud world. So, is serverless a viable approach for your multi-cloud strategy? If we decide that it is, which tactics could we use in our dev process to overcome the current interop challenges?","streamprovider":"","startdate":"07/19/2024","starttime":"12:20:00","enddate":"07/19/2024","endtime":"12:50:00","type":"Talk","stage":"","format":"in-person","topics":"Cloud","speakers":[{"firstname":"Tomislav","lastname":"Tipurić","jobtitle":"CTO","company":"Nephos","bio":"Tomislav is the CTO and partner in Nephos, a company that successfully supports the digital journey of its clients.

But it is not only developers who benefit from these tools; it's hackers too. AI doesn't care if you are a defender or an attacker. This means bad actors can leverage the amazing capabilities of AI tools to write exploit code – even if they are not full-stack developers or penetration testers. This is concerning and underscores why code security is critical for the safety of society and organisations. When used responsibly, AI can help solve the greatest obstacle to successful software security programs: the imbalance that exists between the effort developers spend finding flaws and the time to fix them. In this session, I will show how I used AI to write an exploit for a publicly know vulnerability. I’m not a “real” developer and only coding for fun. AI made it very simple for me to write a full working exploit.

Appropriately sized hardware can deal with heavy load, if it is available. Well written software intelligently utilizes the available resources, such as memory, network, threads, etc.  The JVM left a lot to be desired here. Especially when it came to managing a limited number of threads. They were an expensive commodity and concurrency is always difficult to implement. Reactive frameworks such as WebFlux, RxJava or Kotlin's  coroutines closed this gap. However, these frameworks are cumbersome. They take some time to really master.

The reason is that such test suites often test too much and too little at the same time. They test too much because they include tests that incur costs but provide little added value compared to similar tests. They test too little because important functionality remains untested.  In the talk, I will present analyses mine data from your repos (version control, issue tracker, test coverage etc) to uncover these issues: Pareto optimization of test suites and test impact analysis identify the tests that currently have the best cost-benefit ratio. Test gap analysis reveals which code changes are still untested, indicating missing tests.   By doing so, these analyses provide us as developers with effective tools to understand and improve our test architecture. For each analysis, I outline its research background and show practical examples from large systems.","streamprovider":"","startdate":"07/19/2024","starttime":"15:00:00","enddate":"07/19/2024","endtime":"15:30:00","type":"Talk","stage":"Stage 10","format":"in-person","topics":"Product Quality","speakers":[{"firstname":"Elmar","lastname":"Jürgens","jobtitle":"Founder","company":"CQSE GmbH","bio":"Elmar works both as a researcher and a founder.

It’s where ideas meet execution.  All teams want to bring quality designs to production, faster. But this is challenging because it requires close alignment between design and development — two disciplines that operate with different tools, languages, and objectives. Poor collaboration leads to increased toil for both sides and results in slower innovation and ship times.   Bridging the gap between these design and development teams is the key to unlocking more team happiness and better product outcomes.  In this session, experts from Figma and Atlassian (Jira) will share 5 core best practices and practical tips to improve designer-developer collaboration for faster ship times, improved teamwork and better overall results.","streamprovider":"youtube","startdate":"07/19/2024","starttime":"16:20:00","enddate":"07/19/2024","endtime":"16:50:00","type":"Talk","stage":"Stage 11","format":"live","topics":"People & Culture","speakers":[{"firstname":"Jade","lastname":"Jiang","jobtitle":"Product Designer","company":"Atlassian","bio":"Jade is a Product Designer at Atlassian who is passionate about combining design and psychology to solve problems.
