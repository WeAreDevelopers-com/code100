# I can't even!

This time the puzzle is about taking a string and only get the uneven letters of the alphabet from it. 

So, if the input would be `abcdefABCDEEEEF` the result would be `aceACE` as `a` is uneven (`1`) and `B` is even (`2`) as is `f` (`6`). `E` is included a few times but should only be there once, just like all the others.

The string to clean up is [string.txt](string.txt) and the result should be `25' letters long - good luck!
