# CODE100 Puzzle: Thumbs up for the old school

The challenge was the following: 

If `44-33-555-555-666` is `hello` and `9-666-777-555-3` is `world`, what is: 
```
9-33-0-2-777-33-0-3-33-888-33-555-666-7-33-777-7777
```
Can you do an encoder/decoder for this way of writing?

What we are dealing with here is the way you texted on old feature phones. Each key represented several characters and you had to press them a few times to type a letter. 

{% include smallimage.html alt="Old Mobile Device" src="mobile.jpg" %}

So, to type `a` you would press `2` once, to type `c` you had to pressed `2` three times. To type `o` you pressed `6` three times and so on…

To convert the message here, the first thing to do is to define the keyset as an object:

```javascript
const keycodes = {
    "0": " ", "2": "abc", "3": "def",
    "4": "ghi", "5": "jkl", "6": "mno",
    "7": "pqrs", "8": "tuv", "9": "wxyz"
};
```

Decoding the message works - for example in JavaScript - the following way:

```javascript
const decode = message => {
    let result = [];
    message.split('-').forEach(item => {
        result.push(keycodes[item[0]][item.length-1]);
    })
    return result.join('');
};
```

* You define an array called `result`.
* You split the message into chunks at the - and loop over them
* This gives you strings like 9, 33, 0, 2, 777…
* You take the first letter of each of those strings (`item[0]`) and use it as they key of the object `keycodes`. You use the `length` of each item to get the right entry in the keyset. 
* So, if the string is `777`, we get the `keyset[7]`, which is `pqrs` and the third item, which is `r`.
* You add that as a new item to the array `result`.
* Once all the chunks are done, you join the `result` array back into a string.

That's all there is to decode the message. Encoding a text into this format is a bit trickier.

```javascript
const encode = text => {
    return text.split('').map(letter => {
        let str = '';
        Object.keys(keycodes).forEach(key => {
            if (keycodes[key].includes(letter)) {
                str = key.repeat(keycodes[key].indexOf(letter) + 1);
            };
        });
        return str;
    }).join('-');
};
```

* You take the text and split it into single letters.
* You start a new, empty string called `str`
* You loop over all the keys of the keycode object and check if their value includes the letter.
* If it does, you detect where in the value the letter is using `indexOf` and repeat the key value that amount of time. 
* So if the letter is `r`, you detect that it is in the object property `7` as the third letter, which makes `str` the value of `777`. Or `w` would be in the `9` property as the first value, which makes `str` also `9`. 
* You return `str` to override the original chunk of the array that resulted in the split.
* Once all letters are done, you join the splitted array back into a string with a `-` delimiter.

ALl this would have the desired results:

```javascript
console.log(decode('9-33-0-2-777-33-0-3-33-888-33-555-666-7-33-777-7777'))
// = we are developers
console.log(encode('sore thumbs'))
// = 7777-666-777-33-0-8-44-88-6-22-7777
```

We need a delimiter string like - in the code, as, for example `777777` would be ambiguous. Is it `rr` or `qqq` or `ps`?
