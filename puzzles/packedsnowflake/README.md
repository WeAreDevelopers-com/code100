# Packed snowflake

Welcome to another CODE100 puzzle. This time your task, should you want to take it on, is to create an [ASCII art snowflake](https://wearedevelopers-com.github.io/code100/puzzles/packedsnowflake/result.txt) from [this dataset](https://wearedevelopers-com.github.io/code100/puzzles/packedsnowflake/data.json):

```JSON
[
    "❄️","3x32",46,"6x32",
    46,"❄️","3x32",95,92,47,"2x32",92,
    47,95,"❄️","4x32",95,92,47,
    92,47,95,"❄️",95,92,95,92,95,92,47,92,47,95,
    47,95,47,95,"❄️",32,47,32,47,95,47,92,47,92,95,
    92,32,92,"❄️","4x32",95,47,92,47,
    92,95,"❄️","4x32",47,92,"2x32",47,
    92,"❄️","3x32",39,"6x32",39,"❄️"
]
```

The [result](https://wearedevelopers-com.github.io/code100/puzzles/packedsnowflake/result.txt) should look like this:


```
   .      .
   _\/  \/_
    _\/\/_

 / /_/\/\_\ \
    _/\/\_
    /\  /\
