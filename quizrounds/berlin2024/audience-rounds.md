1. Given the following CSS, what colour will the text be in the grandchild element?

    ```css
    .parent .child .grandchild { color: red; }
    .parent > .child > .grandchild { color: blue; }
    .grandchild { color: green; }
    .child + .child .grandchild { color: orange; }
    ```

    Answers: 

    * Red
    * Blue (correct answer)
    * Green
    * Orange

    The answer is blue, because it is the most specific selector.

1. Based on the following CSS, what will the height of the parent element be?

    ```css
    #parent {
        width: 100px; 
        height: auto;
        display: relative;
    }
    #parent > #child-1 {
        width: 100px; 
        height: 100px;
        margin-bottom: 20px;
    }
    #parent > #child-2 {
        width: 100px; 
        height: 100px;
        margin-top: 20px;
    }
    ```

    Answers: 

    * 220px (correct answer)
    * 240px
    * 200px
    * 210px

    The height will be 220px, because the margins will collapse.
