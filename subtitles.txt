WEBVTT

00:00.175 --> 00:03.951
To build soign european AI compute infrastructure. Please welcome on

00:03.983 --> 00:07.615
stage Marus Hacr from Nvidia, Roseanne Kinsset Smith

00:07.655 --> 00:11.815
from Norton Data Group, Daniel Abu from German AI association,

00:11.935 --> 00:13.995
and Michael Bradley from NA.

00:29.435 --> 00:33.051
So hello and thank you for attending our little chat

00:33.083 --> 00:36.523
for the next 30 minutes. My name is Daniel Abou, general manager of the

00:36.539 --> 00:40.851
German AI association. We represent like 460

00:40.963 --> 00:44.315
startups and scale ups from Germany with the focus on

00:44.355 --> 00:48.051
AI development. And I'm really happy to moderate this panel here

00:48.083 --> 00:51.915
at the world of the we are Developers conference, and thank you so much also

00:51.955 --> 00:55.279
to the organization of inviting us, and we are very

00:55.327 --> 00:59.079
happy to chat to you today about the

00:59.127 --> 01:02.847
important issue on how to build a sovereign AI compute

01:02.951 --> 01:07.071
infrastructure. Roseanne Kincai Smith

01:07.223 --> 01:10.583
is the CEO of the Northern Data group. She is one of

01:10.599 --> 01:13.807
the driving forces behind northern Data to ascend as

01:13.831 --> 01:18.155
one of the premier providers of high performance computing.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.727
And of course, Rosean drives the business strategy and

01:21.751 --> 01:25.225
has successfully overseen the global teams. And rose

01:25.345 --> 01:28.633
expertise extends to managing and comprehensive

01:28.689 --> 01:33.169
organizational transformation for northern data, but of course also

01:33.297 --> 01:37.089
for their clients. Michael Bradley

01:37.257 --> 01:40.965
is the CEO and founder of Nua Software.

01:41.305 --> 01:45.617
N Software is implementing state of the art technology and the restaurant

01:45.721 --> 01:49.409
industry. They have a very quick, easy self checkout

01:49.457 --> 01:53.097
solution for a company. Company restaurants in

01:53.121 --> 01:56.929
Germany we call them Cantina, but now they're called business or company

01:56.977 --> 02:00.513
restaurants. That requires the latest technology in the

02:00.529 --> 02:04.689
field of artificial intelligence and computer vision. We will be very interesting

02:04.817 --> 02:08.769
to hear how AI is implemented in the canain and

02:08.897 --> 02:12.537
someone who is also quite an extensive knowledge about the restaurant

02:12.601 --> 02:16.641
business, but now definitely in other ways, is Marus

02:16.673 --> 02:20.725
Har. He is the regional director enterprises for

02:20.765 --> 02:24.349
Nvidia in the so called Dach region. The Dach region is

02:24.397 --> 02:26.985
the Deutschtereich Schweitz.

02:27.725 --> 02:31.141
Since 2019, he leads the activities in

02:31.213 --> 02:34.025
Central Europe and encourages, of course,

02:34.805 --> 02:38.989
also his clients of adapting these products. He has an engineering

02:39.037 --> 02:42.709
background and he built a successful it career at Microsoft T Systems

02:42.757 --> 02:46.383
in AgMA. So guys, this, this is

02:46.439 --> 02:50.039
our topic today, how to build a sovereign AI

02:50.087 --> 02:53.703
compute infrastructure. I think it's always

02:53.759 --> 02:57.447
interesting to know why it's important. Why do

02:57.471 --> 03:01.295
we need a sovereign AI infrastructure in

03:01.335 --> 03:04.807
Europe? Perhaps, Rosanne, you can start with your

03:04.911 --> 03:08.915
preliminary thinking about that luminary thinking. I like that.

03:09.575 --> 03:12.561
I think broadly for us as a business,

03:12.703 --> 03:17.901
and we are an infrastructure business, high performance computing solutions has

03:17.933 --> 03:20.425
its foundations in the AI revolution.

03:21.245 --> 03:24.653
AI is full of promise, and I think we've heard a number of speakers mention

03:24.709 --> 03:28.437
about the sort of revolutionary steps that it is bringing to business as a

03:28.461 --> 03:33.105
whole. And as Michael will walk us through just how advancing

03:33.645 --> 03:36.925
what we can get from society. But more broadly,

03:37.045 --> 03:40.745
everything from Cyberur to medicine is

03:40.785 --> 03:44.169
being impacted by AI. But that then starts

03:44.217 --> 03:47.205
to ask a lot of questions. Data privacy,

03:47.625 --> 03:51.513
sustainability, how we

03:51.529 --> 03:54.985
are investing, where we are investing, and making sure

03:55.025 --> 03:59.041
that all of that information is curated effectively to

03:59.073 --> 04:02.937
get the right outcomes. If we are not purposeful about how we

04:03.001 --> 04:07.365
implement that infrastructure, we will get the wrong results from AI.

04:09.325 --> 04:12.717
Michael, in the sense of why is it important to

04:12.741 --> 04:15.845
have european infrastructure in AI?

04:15.965 --> 04:19.005
Could you tell us, because of your company,

04:19.165 --> 04:22.625
why it is important for you to adapt this?

04:22.925 --> 04:27.333
Well, I would say that in

04:27.349 --> 04:30.945
the case of our company, it's a must have.

04:31.325 --> 04:36.229
It's imperative that we have a local ecosystem here supplying

04:36.277 --> 04:38.985
our customers. The product we build,

04:39.325 --> 04:42.653
sure, it's a global product. It can be used in America, it can be used

04:42.669 --> 04:46.277
in China, but our customer base is very european

04:46.461 --> 04:50.365
related. And there are many, many stipulations about

04:50.445 --> 04:51.585
data security,

04:54.685 --> 04:57.865
all the regulations that to be found in Germany,

04:58.165 --> 05:02.225
it's essential that the data that we store in our system is

05:02.265 --> 05:06.209
located on european soil. And that's where we partnered with

05:06.297 --> 05:09.785
Taiga Cloud. If I may ask, Michael, in the sense of,

05:09.865 --> 05:13.553
when you say the business, restaurants and stuff like that, perhaps people will ask,

05:13.729 --> 05:16.969
why is data sensitivity and what I eat

05:17.057 --> 05:20.233
important? The food on the

05:20.249 --> 05:23.565
tray is irrelevant as long as they pay for it.

05:24.105 --> 05:27.915
No, typically, you will not just find

05:28.215 --> 05:31.755
food, but there are plenty of non food items which are

05:32.135 --> 05:35.995
maybe less critical, like a person's employee card.

05:36.775 --> 05:40.655
Not such a big issue. But you could have documents

05:40.775 --> 05:42.955
and all sorts of data,

05:45.415 --> 05:49.039
all sorts of things on the tray, which would violate

05:49.087 --> 05:52.303
the users privacy if they were sent to the cloud unfiltered.

05:52.439 --> 05:56.095
All right. And stored in a foreign country. Yeah, it's a very

05:56.135 --> 06:00.475
valid point you're making. Marus Nvidia is a global company

06:00.775 --> 06:04.675
that you can definitely say. So why

06:05.015 --> 06:09.503
is it important for a global company also to emphasize

06:09.639 --> 06:14.439
that Europe has its own sovereign AI infrastructure?

06:14.567 --> 06:18.543
That's a very good question. And actually, I just would

06:18.599 --> 06:22.079
need to repeat what Roseanne said and what Michael said, because they

06:22.167 --> 06:25.943
actually, they wrapped it already up pretty nicely. But to

06:25.999 --> 06:28.635
extend that a little bit from how we see it.

06:29.655 --> 06:33.087
So you're obviously right. We are a global company,

06:33.191 --> 06:36.735
but we think in local ecosystems, and we are

06:36.775 --> 06:40.143
very eager to support local ecosystems. So the ecosystem in

06:40.159 --> 06:44.491
the Dachch region, the ecosystem in Germany, and for that, we need local partnerships.

06:44.663 --> 06:48.387
We need organizations like nor VA or Tiger is

06:48.571 --> 06:52.215
their cloud brand, who invests

06:52.715 --> 06:55.811
in, as we call it, AI factories.

06:55.963 --> 06:59.387
We can call it infrastructure for AI, but we actually call

06:59.411 --> 07:03.235
it AI factories. And in this, Roseann called it

07:03.275 --> 07:06.611
thei revolution. And I heard some other people who call it in a

07:06.643 --> 07:10.523
similar way. It's the fourth industrial revolution that

07:10.539 --> 07:13.625
we see here. And at the first time,

07:14.045 --> 07:17.625
we as human mankind, we have the capability

07:18.005 --> 07:22.105
to build factories that produce intelligence, so called tokens,

07:22.605 --> 07:25.893
technically speaking, by putting data and electrons

07:25.989 --> 07:29.309
into such a factory and getting tokens, hands intelligence

07:29.357 --> 07:32.885
out of that factory. And that's a pretty big step.

07:33.005 --> 07:36.725
And it's important to do that step, of course, globally, but also think

07:36.765 --> 07:41.205
locally, so support local ecosystem. And also

07:42.145 --> 07:46.625
one of our key values globally is to democratize

07:46.785 --> 07:50.489
AI. So we are not looking that

07:50.537 --> 07:54.201
AI is a tool which is just in the hands of a couple of

07:54.233 --> 07:57.513
people or a couple of big companies, but we want to

07:57.569 --> 08:01.961
support that. AI is being used by as many people as possible, and also is

08:01.993 --> 08:05.741
used by smaller companies. And neweroft obviously is a startup

08:05.813 --> 08:09.389
company. And Michael summarized it for all that topics

08:09.437 --> 08:13.305
like data sovereignty, data protection, GDPR. He was looking

08:13.885 --> 08:17.501
for a local partner in the region, and we were able by the partnership with

08:17.533 --> 08:21.357
Tiger north and data to offer that partnership. And basically we

08:21.381 --> 08:25.181
want to let the customer choose. We have global partnerships with all the big cloud

08:25.253 --> 08:28.669
providers. That's good, that's important, and that's the global strategy.

08:28.797 --> 08:32.753
But in the end, the customer should and needs to decide

08:32.849 --> 08:36.137
on where he wants to go to. And for that, it's important to provide

08:36.161 --> 08:39.409
their choices. And we are pretty glad to have that partnership and are

08:39.457 --> 08:44.665
supporting that in many ways. Roseanne Marcus

08:44.745 --> 08:48.329
just spoke about local ecosystems. How important

08:48.377 --> 08:51.921
are local ecosystems for you at the northern

08:51.953 --> 08:55.745
data group? And certainly also a question which belongs to that

08:55.865 --> 08:59.985
is, how can Europe remain competitive

09:00.405 --> 09:03.985
in AI? Because your firm, situated in London,

09:04.405 --> 09:08.229
I would say I think that's no breaking news for anyone, that the

09:08.277 --> 09:12.173
US and China are quite on the forefront of AI. But how can

09:12.229 --> 09:15.773
Europe make this? And what importance do local ecosystems

09:15.829 --> 09:19.693
have? Yeah, I mean, I think you've got this massive

09:19.749 --> 09:22.829
global race on with AI at the moment. And Marcus

09:22.877 --> 09:26.189
mentioned democratization, and that is a core ethos of our business

09:26.237 --> 09:30.545
too. And that goes hand in hand with local ecosystems.

09:31.005 --> 09:34.445
As a business, we have a responsibility to ensure that that

09:34.525 --> 09:37.933
access is granted, but not just the access,

09:38.109 --> 09:41.605
making sure that skills are provided, that we as a business

09:41.685 --> 09:45.445
encourage the right types of partnerships or the right type of customers,

09:45.565 --> 09:49.177
and we expand that ecosystem. If we

09:49.201 --> 09:53.265
don't take that accountability, AI will definitely

09:53.385 --> 09:56.689
take that swerve into being the purview of just a few

09:56.857 --> 10:00.569
and so that local ecosystem, making sure that it's fit for purpose

10:00.617 --> 10:04.089
to that environment, that the skills are being developed, is what's

10:04.137 --> 10:07.809
going to help drive Europe forward and hopefully

10:07.857 --> 10:11.729
outpace the rest of the world. Because certainly Europe has some of the brightest

10:11.817 --> 10:15.177
minds and some of the highest educational standards in the

10:15.201 --> 10:18.753
world. So the more we can embrace that to bring

10:18.809 --> 10:22.425
AI into the local ecosystems and use some of the high

10:22.505 --> 10:26.105
standards that Europe applies to businesses, the better for

10:26.145 --> 10:29.937
us. Marus, if I can, back to you

10:30.081 --> 10:34.457
what Roa just said, having a kind of

10:34.561 --> 10:38.225
european AI. So a good friend of mine once told me the sentence,

10:38.385 --> 10:42.279
if you asked cheat CPTT a question, you get a californian answer.

10:42.457 --> 10:46.695
So in this sense, I found it at least

10:47.435 --> 10:51.043
noteworthy to say this. But why is it

10:51.099 --> 10:54.683
important? Is it important about languages, cultures? Why do you think

10:54.779 --> 10:57.835
it's important to have that, all of that, what you just said is important?

10:57.875 --> 11:01.307
Languages matters because languages are actually

11:01.411 --> 11:05.643
culture. And in

11:05.659 --> 11:09.371
the end, it comes down to the data that models are being trained

11:09.403 --> 11:13.171
with. Those models are not

11:13.363 --> 11:15.867
selfident beings or whatever,

11:15.971 --> 11:19.131
but it's an algorithm

11:19.203 --> 11:23.419
that is using basically later in inferencing

11:23.587 --> 11:26.975
the data which is being trained with. And of course,

11:27.955 --> 11:31.715
you can see probably which kind of data had been used to train which

11:31.755 --> 11:35.355
algorithm, and that's then influencing

11:35.435 --> 11:39.571
the answers that you get. And speaking of local ecosystem,

11:39.603 --> 11:43.147
and speaking of local companies, we are quite proud to have a

11:43.211 --> 11:46.923
company like DeepL, also in the region, who and

11:46.939 --> 11:52.171
you spoke about language and about culture and deep else wion

11:52.203 --> 11:55.963
is to break down those language barriers by providing

11:56.019 --> 11:59.083
translation systems that can be used by everyone in

11:59.099 --> 12:03.393
a proper way. And they use AI basically to. To transl

12:03.449 --> 12:08.297
meanwh translate, meanwhile, 35 and 40 languages into

12:08.321 --> 12:11.673
the other one, and in neutral tests,

12:11.809 --> 12:15.965
seen as the most accurate platform for that

12:16.345 --> 12:20.005
globally. Michael, can I ask you about the

12:20.545 --> 12:23.537
competitiveness? So you're from Ireland originally,

12:23.601 --> 12:26.753
you're now situated in Munich, so you have also a european

12:26.809 --> 12:32.031
perspective on things. How do you see the AI infrastructure

12:32.103 --> 12:35.991
problematic in Europe? And how do you profit,

12:36.063 --> 12:38.835
perhaps from a local ecosystem? Well,

12:40.575 --> 12:44.895
an ecosystem consists of many components, starting with

12:45.015 --> 12:49.223
GPU's, when we're talking about AI that Nvidia provide,

12:49.399 --> 12:53.603
Taiga cloud providing a platform for developers or companies,

12:53.759 --> 12:57.587
startups like me, but it also needs people.

12:57.771 --> 13:00.055
And I see a serious.

13:02.555 --> 13:06.363
When I compare where we are in Europe today with the

13:06.379 --> 13:10.099
likes of other global places like the States

13:10.227 --> 13:13.899
and China, I see a great deficit in the

13:13.947 --> 13:17.763
number of data scientists, engineers here that can really

13:17.819 --> 13:21.183
make this ecosystem come alive. And I

13:21.199 --> 13:24.751
would love to see european initiatives that help out

13:24.903 --> 13:28.471
small startups and educating

13:28.663 --> 13:32.887
our workforceces. You're totally right. We have some of the brightest minds

13:33.071 --> 13:36.367
in Europe and we need to make a europ force in

13:36.391 --> 13:38.635
AI and this only happens with people.

13:39.855 --> 13:43.431
So one of the things I realized that in my

13:43.503 --> 13:46.953
position in the german AI associated is that when we have

13:46.969 --> 13:50.593
a call with our members and we talk to them,

13:50.729 --> 13:54.925
sometimes I'call it group therapy. But in this case, you know,

13:55.905 --> 13:59.449
we ask them what are your biggest challenges? And as there are mostly

13:59.537 --> 14:02.913
startups and scale ups, of course financing is always place one.

14:03.009 --> 14:06.929
But the second thing they have really a challenge is the

14:07.057 --> 14:10.369
implementation of AI products in SME's, in european

14:10.417 --> 14:14.601
or german SME's. So what

14:14.633 --> 14:18.209
can you do as company and firms besides selling

14:18.257 --> 14:22.305
the products of helping german and european industry reap

14:22.345 --> 14:25.605
the benefits of AI? Where are the possibilities?

14:26.465 --> 14:30.017
So I mean, as we were saying, democratization is core to

14:30.041 --> 14:33.401
our ethos and we share that as an ethos with Nvidia

14:33.433 --> 14:37.075
and with our customers. Our right

14:37.115 --> 14:40.491
there is our accountability as a business is to make sure

14:40.523 --> 14:44.419
that we actually practice what we preach. And so when we say we democratize

14:44.507 --> 14:47.707
access, we actually have a program that we run at our business. It's called

14:47.731 --> 14:51.371
the AI accelerator. We invite companies who

14:51.483 --> 14:55.403
do not have access to the kinds of capital that is required

14:55.459 --> 14:58.803
to operate on H 100s for instance, and for

14:58.819 --> 15:02.147
them to pitch that idea to us. We then give them access free

15:02.171 --> 15:05.883
of charge to our hardware to allow them to develop that proof

15:05.899 --> 15:09.291
of concept. We also provide coaching for their mentorship,

15:09.443 --> 15:12.211
including opportunities to raise capital,

15:12.323 --> 15:16.563
including investment from us. Because as I said and

15:16.579 --> 15:20.131
as Michael and everybody

15:20.163 --> 15:23.691
has underscored, that we need to make sure that we are

15:23.763 --> 15:27.619
providing substance to the ecosystem and skills is definitely

15:27.667 --> 15:30.911
the parth to that. And so the least we can do is to provide that

15:30.983 --> 15:34.519
access to the hardware. How do

15:34.527 --> 15:38.327
you see the possibilities and where can you help the

15:38.391 --> 15:42.103
european or AI industry? About AI? Because selling the

15:42.159 --> 15:45.479
product is one thing, but implementing is I think definitely another.

15:45.527 --> 15:48.775
Yeah, I fully agree. Andman,

15:48.815 --> 15:52.247
the famous german midittelstand is actually the

15:52.271 --> 15:56.435
backbone of our economy. That'something which

15:56.475 --> 16:00.219
we need to explain often

16:00.267 --> 16:04.075
globally, because this way how the

16:04.115 --> 16:07.875
german economy works is pretty unique. That is

16:07.915 --> 16:11.195
not the same in the US, that is not the same in other countries,

16:11.235 --> 16:14.935
but that's very specific in Germany. And that's kind of,

16:15.675 --> 16:20.031
how should I say, eangelism almost that we need to do with

16:20.083 --> 16:23.335
our global organization. Say listen, this is

16:23.495 --> 16:27.567
an important part of the german economy and we need to help them and we

16:27.591 --> 16:31.303
need to make sure that they have the ability to

16:31.319 --> 16:35.383
adopt a eye. And Michael just made a very good point. That's about people.

16:35.519 --> 16:38.671
It's about people. It's about talent and talent in

16:38.703 --> 16:42.431
AI. They, and they are looking for places where

16:42.503 --> 16:46.001
they can do their work. And data scientists,

16:46.103 --> 16:49.265
they need proper infrastructure, they need access to compute,

16:50.485 --> 16:53.581
to proper compute, to train the models to

16:53.613 --> 16:57.517
inference, the models to fine tune them. And therefore,

16:57.541 --> 17:00.773
it's also important to give them opportunities locally where

17:00.789 --> 17:04.597
they can access, compute and do their work. And that's one thing, another thing

17:04.621 --> 17:08.053
that is important, which is also deeply in the DNA of Nvidia.

17:08.229 --> 17:11.568
We are very eager to engage with developers.

17:11.676 --> 17:14.392
That's why we are here. That's why we have a bo here. I can just

17:14.448 --> 17:18.324
encourage everyone to come to Ourus at Hall 2.2.

17:19.104 --> 17:23.448
And we, for example, do courses to

17:23.576 --> 17:26.920
refine the skills of programmers.

17:26.952 --> 17:30.644
In terms of AI, there's different courses in computer vision,

17:31.624 --> 17:35.192
in building different AI platforms, and it's all about people, and it's

17:35.208 --> 17:39.101
all about talent, and hence that trans of knowledge into

17:39.133 --> 17:42.733
the community of developers. It's another thing where we

17:42.829 --> 17:46.533
put a very high emphasis to and want to support the local ecosystem also

17:46.549 --> 17:50.573
with their efforts. And Marcus is forgetting that in

17:50.629 --> 17:54.125
Europe, we tend to be a little bit more skeptical of everything, and particularly

17:54.165 --> 17:57.765
the Germans. Yeah, but ro, exactly to your point,

17:57.925 --> 18:01.985
the skeptical thing. So when we talk to our companies,

18:03.295 --> 18:07.115
what is the problematics between you connecting to SME's?

18:07.655 --> 18:11.895
And I think the picture that, it's just my personal opinion,

18:12.015 --> 18:15.311
but we have, you have on the one side, the 65

18:15.383 --> 18:18.335
year old family SME owner. Yeah,

18:18.375 --> 18:21.815
from Swabia or from Bavaria, who lives like for

18:21.855 --> 18:25.071
40 years in his data silo. On the other hand,

18:25.103 --> 18:29.407
you have the 25 year old AI entrepreneur from Berlinreutitzberg,

18:29.591 --> 18:32.895
we talks, who says to the 65 year old, well,

18:32.935 --> 18:36.111
you should do data sharing with your competitors

18:36.263 --> 18:39.631
that we should do in a cloud system, and then we can perhaps develop an

18:39.663 --> 18:44.583
AI project. And when the 65 year old hears

18:44.679 --> 18:48.195
that he should do data sharing with his competitors, he's out.

18:49.215 --> 18:53.151
So what danger? Isn't this also a

18:53.183 --> 18:57.035
kind of, I would like, say, generational problem with handling of

18:57.075 --> 19:00.779
data? I mean, so quite, I was recently attended

19:00.907 --> 19:04.683
a dinner where people were sort of talking about the priorities between AI and

19:04.739 --> 19:08.139
politics. So what's being discussed at your boardroom table at the moment?

19:08.307 --> 19:12.307
And almost without exception, people were talking about AI and

19:12.331 --> 19:16.171
not about pending elections, which I thought was quite interesting because they kind of go

19:16.203 --> 19:19.483
hand in hand. But that does show generational gap,

19:19.579 --> 19:22.939
because actually, what's front and center was for the

19:22.987 --> 19:26.451
majority of younger people is, well, one, what is

19:26.483 --> 19:29.867
AI going to mean for me in the future for older people? You're like,

19:29.971 --> 19:33.555
does that mean that it's going to impact my business, impact my job?

19:33.675 --> 19:37.219
Where does the longevity of that sit? And that goes back to my comments

19:37.267 --> 19:40.555
about us being quite skeptical about what AI will,

19:40.675 --> 19:43.987
how it will impact us. So it's in the nature of

19:44.011 --> 19:47.579
us certainly I think to look at the negative side, in contrast

19:47.627 --> 19:50.915
maybe to the North Americans, where everything is an opportunity.

19:51.375 --> 19:54.511
So we've tended to focus ono those sort of narrow things.

19:54.543 --> 19:57.995
And it's why I think we are seeing the gaps emerge on skills

19:58.535 --> 20:01.967
and the sort of like gaps in the ecosystem because there's too

20:01.991 --> 20:05.311
much cynicism around it, because we think the

20:05.383 --> 20:08.951
impact will be negative. And as I mentioned to you guys

20:09.023 --> 20:12.607
outside, so people tend to be scared of AI, but it's no competition for

20:12.631 --> 20:16.297
natural human stupidity. So I think we're going to be okay

20:16.441 --> 20:20.409
if we learn to use it the right way. One question

20:20.457 --> 20:23.833
for the group is that in exactly what you say, the skepticism and

20:23.849 --> 20:27.609
stuff like that, but isn't the problem also in the skepticism that

20:27.657 --> 20:30.961
the discussion about AI is like in extremes,

20:31.113 --> 20:34.785
you have the tech bubble who says I overemphasize my point.

20:34.865 --> 20:38.721
It's a reincarnation of Jesus Christ. And the contraoint is that

20:38.833 --> 20:41.741
AI is, is the terminate,

20:41.893 --> 20:46.221
the worst thing that ever happens. Isn't it time to

20:46.253 --> 20:49.781
demystify AI to make it about concrete products,

20:49.853 --> 20:53.629
which Michael is doing and things

20:53.677 --> 20:57.701
like that? 100% agreed. And Michael's

20:57.733 --> 21:01.781
offering, the offering of his company is a perfect example

21:01.893 --> 21:05.973
because it really solves and accurates and an actual

21:06.029 --> 21:09.567
problem. All those operators of those

21:09.631 --> 21:12.959
canteens of those business restaurants, they simply don't find

21:13.007 --> 21:17.111
people who do the checkout anymore. And, you know,

21:17.303 --> 21:21.015
so people have the choice of using the alpha checkout or don't

21:21.055 --> 21:23.767
get lunch. What do you prefer? Do you want to get lunch or do you

21:23.791 --> 21:27.703
want to use the AI checkout system? It's about making use cases

21:27.879 --> 21:31.071
that are touchable for people. And I, I see

21:31.103 --> 21:34.545
the same like controversy discussions that you just

21:34.585 --> 21:37.897
mentioned, Daniel, and I think the only way to get rid of that step by

21:37.921 --> 21:41.817
step, and that will take a while and it will be a

21:41.841 --> 21:45.081
journey for all of us in this industry.

21:45.193 --> 21:48.441
We need to take people with us on the journey and we need to

21:48.473 --> 21:53.297
explain it. We need to make it judgeable. That's the

21:53.321 --> 21:57.673
levers that we need to pull to get rid of this very controversial

21:57.729 --> 22:00.913
discussions that we have. How do you convince a

22:00.969 --> 22:05.105
skeptical cantteen owner to adapt

22:05.225 --> 22:09.153
something which is normally something very manual. People are cooking,

22:09.289 --> 22:12.633
people are getting their food, they're eating. How do you

22:12.689 --> 22:16.217
convince them of doing AI,

22:16.401 --> 22:19.961
to do generalization and doing

22:19.993 --> 22:23.465
it automatically? How can you convince. And it

22:23.545 --> 22:26.321
depends on the stakeholder. So, for example,

22:26.393 --> 22:29.961
the owner of the canteen, he's trying to solve

22:29.993 --> 22:33.385
a problem that he wants to sell food,

22:33.505 --> 22:36.857
but nobody wants to man the cashier. And then you've

22:36.881 --> 22:40.481
got the retri slider. So the person

22:40.553 --> 22:44.537
responsible for the restaurant, you have to make their

22:44.681 --> 22:48.929
job simple. You cannot overcomplicate

22:48.977 --> 22:53.101
matters. It has to be as simple as I take an image of

22:53.173 --> 22:56.865
the food on the day AI goes away, does its thing,

22:57.645 --> 23:00.933
five minutes later they're ready for service. It has to be

23:00.949 --> 23:04.173
that simple. The only thing in pre sales,

23:04.229 --> 23:07.533
which is always an issue, is you have to take away the fear. The fear.

23:07.589 --> 23:11.385
Where'my data landing? I don't want to harp on, on data, but data is,

23:11.765 --> 23:14.893
and it depends always on the size of the company you're operating with.

23:15.029 --> 23:18.131
There are regular in place and you have to take away that fear

23:18.243 --> 23:22.339
that, for example, if a customer wants on premise inferencing,

23:22.467 --> 23:26.091
we give it to them because they don't want to take the risk that the

23:26.123 --> 23:30.187
data is landing on some cloud in some location where

23:30.211 --> 23:33.731
they have no control over. So it's about flexibility and taking away

23:33.763 --> 23:37.215
fear. I can, don't know what else I should say.

23:37.995 --> 23:41.387
So one of the challenges that we realized, especially in

23:41.411 --> 23:45.017
the data infrastructure for AI, also with project that we

23:45.041 --> 23:49.645
did, is that one is convincing

23:50.545 --> 23:54.193
the SME's but also big companies, as I think before JatGPTt

23:54.249 --> 23:58.201
was even worse. So thankfully, this certainly gave

23:58.233 --> 24:02.097
the discussion some momentum. But how

24:02.121 --> 24:05.721
can we see, especially in a time where some,

24:05.873 --> 24:10.049
some economic indicators are, are not that good to

24:10.137 --> 24:14.217
invest in this kind of data infrastructure? Because they'saying,

24:14.281 --> 24:17.245
hey, we don't know where the world is in five years,

24:17.945 --> 24:21.081
why should we invest in this kind of cases?

24:21.273 --> 24:24.925
I mean, I'actually, I've had a number of panelsr

24:25.585 --> 24:29.337
about investment in AI and we can

24:29.361 --> 24:32.193
say that about everything. We won't know where the world will be in five years

24:32.249 --> 24:36.109
time. But the opportunity that AI represents,

24:36.157 --> 24:39.885
certainly to me and from an investment standpoint, is the

24:39.965 --> 24:43.549
opportunity to shape that future, to develop the

24:43.597 --> 24:46.813
technologies in the right way, to bring value

24:46.909 --> 24:50.341
to all the right ecosystems. To your point, take out the fear,

24:50.413 --> 24:53.765
make it really simple about how this will improve your

24:53.805 --> 24:56.785
life and invest behind that.

24:58.245 --> 25:01.275
That's where I see the opportunity. See? Yeah,

25:02.415 --> 25:06.127
I would like to turn it around also in a positive way a little bit.

25:06.151 --> 25:10.127
Daniel I think you guys from Kunusand

25:10.231 --> 25:13.967
play an important role in that'a, very important role inle

25:14.151 --> 25:18.039
in that whole journey to convince people to make it

25:18.087 --> 25:21.719
more a normal technology that simplifies our daily lives,

25:21.887 --> 25:25.813
that solves problems in our daily life, that solves some of the hardest

25:25.919 --> 25:30.085
problems that we have in human mankind. I mean, we still develop

25:30.505 --> 25:33.809
pharmaceuticals, not from a technology

25:33.857 --> 25:38.001
point of view that's very modern, but from a structured

25:38.073 --> 25:41.685
approach. Fromarmaceuticals are still developed like 100 years ago,

25:42.585 --> 25:46.385
the systematic is still the same. So using

25:46.425 --> 25:49.337
AI to develop pharmaceuticals,

25:49.481 --> 25:52.111
drugs for especially rare diseases,

25:52.273 --> 25:55.467
is something which can solve some of the biggest problems that we have in human

25:55.491 --> 25:58.827
mankind, but it can't happen only in

25:58.851 --> 26:02.619
the tech bubble. So, so just that, you know, we have a project running,

26:02.667 --> 26:06.855
it's called liam large european AI models, which is

26:07.155 --> 26:11.443
trying to get the people and the SME's to get data

26:11.499 --> 26:15.587
center time that they can do their models. And we're not talking about GPT

26:15.651 --> 26:19.475
five, six, seven or eight and something like that, but specialized model

26:20.095 --> 26:23.555
which is adaptable for SME's, which is adaptable

26:23.855 --> 26:27.635
for smaller solutions. And exactly what you're saying is that

26:28.415 --> 26:32.199
we have AI can help. It is not the question,

26:32.247 --> 26:35.303
it's not the answer to everything. It's certainly not.

26:35.439 --> 26:38.887
But I think that especially in the time where we have

26:38.911 --> 26:42.527
a skill worker shortage in the time where we have.

26:42.631 --> 26:46.035
So can you tell us the example that you say about

26:46.075 --> 26:50.211
the at the moment or

26:50.283 --> 26:53.547
in other areas where we simply don't have the

26:53.611 --> 26:56.699
human resources anymore to do the things we

26:56.707 --> 27:00.655
are used to do in the current time?

27:01.155 --> 27:05.107
I mean you just said it, it's something that

27:05.251 --> 27:08.823
Deutschean is also dealing very, very openly with,

27:09.019 --> 27:12.463
that they miss like 5000 train drivers currently.

27:12.639 --> 27:15.755
And the structure of age

27:16.495 --> 27:19.591
of this workforce is in a way that

27:19.623 --> 27:23.215
you can clearly forecast how many people go

27:23.375 --> 27:26.887
are going to retire in the next ten years and

27:26.911 --> 27:30.703
that will make the problem huge. So in ten years we

27:30.719 --> 27:34.135
will have just 50% of the train drivers that we would need to

27:34.175 --> 27:37.361
operate trains. So we

27:37.393 --> 27:41.009
need to invest into create self driving trains. Otherwise probably

27:41.057 --> 27:44.569
our transportation system will. And the aren't late,

27:44.617 --> 27:47.929
they simply not there. Exactly. Yeah.

27:48.057 --> 27:51.473
Then no one will be unhappy about ten minutes delay

27:51.529 --> 27:55.505
because the trains will simply not go without the driver. If you don't have autonomous

27:55.545 --> 27:59.177
trains, then let me hit you on one point, is the

27:59.201 --> 28:03.205
question of course of AI and energy consumption and sustainability.

28:03.625 --> 28:06.785
So let's say this is also very, how can I say,

28:06.865 --> 28:10.537
emphatic discussions that they say AI is the

28:10.561 --> 28:14.393
most waste of energy that you have. And how can we or you at the

28:14.409 --> 28:17.553
northern native solve this kind of issue? That AI

28:17.609 --> 28:21.057
needs energy and energy consumption? I mean, the world

28:21.081 --> 28:24.417
is incredibly energy hungry at the moment. And the introduction

28:24.481 --> 28:28.367
of AI and all of these AI factories

28:28.551 --> 28:32.303
has driven up that demand for consumption significantly.

28:32.479 --> 28:36.231
We're talking doubling up on the amount of power that is

28:36.263 --> 28:40.231
required for data centers in the next 48 months. So from 17 gigawatts

28:40.263 --> 28:43.463
to 35 gigawatts in the space of 48 months, that is an

28:43.479 --> 28:47.207
enormous impact on all of the energy grids and all of the energy

28:47.311 --> 28:51.055
consumption and sources that we have today. And never

28:51.095 --> 28:54.867
mind the potential impact from residual heat as

28:54.891 --> 28:58.003
well as from waste that surrounds that. So for us as

28:58.019 --> 29:01.795
a business, we've taken a very, very specific stance on

29:01.835 --> 29:05.611
one. One of the reasons we partner with Nvidia is because it is

29:05.723 --> 29:09.339
some of the best hardware out there. It's extremely energy efficient,

29:09.467 --> 29:12.835
and it's also direct to chip, liquid cooled. That means it's

29:12.875 --> 29:16.295
compliant with our data center environments. It has low.

29:18.655 --> 29:22.235
Yeah, you're here. O yeah, I can't hear myself.

29:24.135 --> 29:27.735
And we also position our data centers in places

29:27.775 --> 29:31.167
where we have full renewable energy sources. And one of the things that's

29:31.191 --> 29:34.687
really important for us to be able to offer to our customers is that carbo

29:34.751 --> 29:38.311
free environment. That way we will be able to

29:38.383 --> 29:42.195
have the benefits of AI without the impact on the environment.

29:43.555 --> 29:47.195
Roseanne Kincaiate Smith, Michael Bradley Markusako,

29:47.315 --> 29:50.803
thank you so much for the discussion. Thank you for the exclusive audience here

29:50.979 --> 29:54.427
for your attention. My name is Daniel Labou. I wish you a very pleasant day

29:54.531 --> 29:57.763
at the conference and goodbye. Daniel, thank you so

29:57.779 --> 29:59.495
much for hosting us. Of course.

30:03.795 --> 30:06.455
Thank you. Rosa still alive.

30:22.255 --> 30:25.991
Okay. Thank you very much. So stay tuned for our next

30:26.023 --> 30:29.551
session. The neo architecture of productivity, how work

30:29.623 --> 30:33.715
environments impact cognitive performance. Ten minutes.

30:34.795 --> 30:35.035
It.
